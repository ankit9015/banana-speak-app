Banana speak app : A project in the slew of projects under neog.camp Level Zero Material


The program is built using Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and fun translation API.

The site takes an input message in English and converts it into Minion speech (or Banana language).

I build this project as a part of a slew of projects in Neog.camp level zero curriculum. The program offers minimum hand holding and the available materials are enough to help whenever need arises.

Please visit my portfolio site for other such projects, I'll really appreciate and thank you for your time.
